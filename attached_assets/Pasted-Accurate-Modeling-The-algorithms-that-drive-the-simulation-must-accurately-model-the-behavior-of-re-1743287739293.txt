Accurate Modeling: The algorithms that drive the simulation must accurately model the behavior of real-world marketing platforms (like Google Ads or Meta Ads). This means understanding how factors like keyword relevance, ad quality, bidding strategies, and targeting parameters affect ad performance.

Data-Driven Simulation: The simulation should generate data that is consistent with real-world marketing data. This includes metrics like impressions, clicks, conversions, cost per click, and cost per acquisition.

Dynamic Simulation: The simulation should be dynamic and responsive to user actions. When users change their campaign settings, the simulation should reflect those changes in real-time.

2. Responsiveness and Speed:

Fast Calculations: The simulation engine should be able to perform calculations quickly and efficiently, so that users don't have to wait long for results.

Real-Time Updates: The data analysis dashboard should update in real-time as the simulation runs, so that users can see the impact of their changes immediately.

Smooth Transitions: The app should have smooth transitions between different screens and sections, so that users don't experience any jarring or disruptive changes.

3. User Control and Customization:

Granular Control: Users should have granular control over their campaign settings, so that they can experiment with different strategies and tactics.

Customizable Parameters: Users should be able to customize the parameters of the simulation, such as the base CTR, conversion rate, and cost per click.

Scenario Creation: Users should be able to create different simulation scenarios to test different marketing strategies.

4. Clear and Understandable Data:

Meaningful Metrics: The data analysis dashboard should display metrics that are meaningful and relevant to users.

Clear Visualizations: The data should be visualized in a clear and easy-to-understand format, using charts, graphs, and tables.

Actionable Insights: The app should provide actionable insights that users can use to improve their marketing strategies.

5. AI-Powered Assistance (If Applicable):

Relevant Suggestions: The AI should provide relevant and helpful suggestions for improving campaign performance.

Personalized Recommendations: The AI should provide personalized recommendations based on the user's campaign settings and goals.

Explainable AI: The AI should be able to explain its recommendations in a clear and understandable way.
