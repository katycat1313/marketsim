      { id: "d", text: "The site has been penalized for having too many backlinks" }
    ],
    explanation: "This page is poorly optimized because it has a generic title ('Welcome'), minimal meta description ('Visit our cafe'), lacks specific keywords, has thin content, a non-descriptive image alt tag, and generic anchor text ('Click here'). These are fundamental on-page SEO issues that would prevent Google from understanding and ranking the content appropriately."

    ],
    explanation: "When optimizing for local SEO, it's important to select keywords that combine your service ('dentist', 'teeth whitening') with location indicators ('Chicago') or local intent phrases ('near me'). Generic terms like 'doctor' are too broad, while 'teeth cleaning cost' lacks local intent, and 'buy dental equipment' targets suppliers rather than patients."

    explanation: "For a premium coffee bean store, good negative keywords are terms that attract users with different intent: 'free coffee samples' (users looking for free products), 'cheap coffee' (price-sensitive users not aligned with premium positioning), and 'coffee maker repair' (users looking for repair services, not beans). The other terms are relevant to selling premium coffee beans."

    explanation: "A unique, detailed product description with naturally incorporated keywords, proper heading structure, and optimized images provides valuable content for both users and search engines.

      yoga mat | 45,000 | High | Not ranking
      best treadmill for home | 18,000 | Medium | Position 28
      affordable exercise bike | 9,500 | Low | Position 15

      { id: "d", text: "fitness equipment maintenance" }
    ],
    explanation: "The keyword 'best treadmill for home' offers the best opportunity because it has substantial search volume (18,000 monthly searches), medium competition (not too difficult to rank for), and the site is already ranking, though not on the first page (position 28). With focused optimization, moving from position 28 to the first page is achievable and would yield significant traffic gains. 'Yoga mat' has higher volume but high competition, 'affordable exercise bike' has lower volume, and 'fitness equipment maintenance' is already ranking well but has the lowest search volume."

    ],
    explanation: "Option C is the most effective because it includes specific services (emergency plumbing, leaks, clogs), location relevance ([City]), trust indicators (licensed, bonded & insured), urgency (24/7, same-day service), and a call-to-action with incentive (10% off). It balances keywords for SEO with compelling benefits to improve click-through rate. Option A is repetitive, B uses excessive capitalization which looks spammy, and D is generic without strong keywords or call-to-action."

    ],
    explanation: "The dramatic increase in page load time (from 1.8s to 8.2s) is the most likely culprit for the drop in organic traffic. Google prioritizes page speed as a ranking factor, and slow-loading pages provide poor user experience. This is supported by the corresponding increase in bounce rate (from 32% to 85%), indicating visitors are leaving quickly due to slow loading. The other metrics show minimal changes or wouldn't cause such a dramatic traffic drop."
