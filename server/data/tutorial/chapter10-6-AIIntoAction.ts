## AI Marketing Applications in Action

### 1. Personalized Email Marketing Campaigns

**Case Study: Beauty Brand Increases Open Rates by 73%**

A mid-sized beauty retailer implemented AI-powered personalization for their email campaigns with impressive results:

```
// Example of how AI personalizes email content blocks
function personalizeEmail(userData) {
  // AI analyzes customer data
  const preferences = analyzePreferences(userData.browsing_history);
  const lifecycle = determineCycle(userData.purchase_history);
  
  // Personalized content is selected based on AI insights
  return {
    subject: getPersonalizedSubject(preferences, lifecycle),
    heroImage: selectRelevantImage(preferences),
    productRecommendations: generateRecommendations(preferences),
