## Data Analysis Framework

### The Analysis Process

### Common Analysis Techniques

#### Trend Analysis
Examining how metrics change over time to identify patterns and anomalies.

**Example**: Analyzing website traffic by month for the past year reveals that your organic traffic has been steadily declining despite social and direct traffic growth, indicating a potential SEO issue.

#### Segmentation
Breaking down data into meaningful groups to uncover deeper insights.

**Example**: Segmenting conversion rates by device shows that mobile users convert at 1.2% while desktop users convert at 3.5%, highlighting a mobile experience problem.

Tracking groups of users who share common characteristics over time.

**Example**: Analyzing customers who signed up during a specific promotion reveals they have a 20% higher lifetime value than other customer cohorts.

#### Funnel Analysis
Examining how users progress through a series of steps toward conversion.

**Example**: A funnel analysis shows a 70% drop-off between adding products to cart and reaching checkout, indicating shopping cart usability issues.

#### Attribution Analysis
Understanding which marketing touchpoints contribute to conversions.

**Example**: Using multi-channel attribution reveals that while paid search gets credit for many last-click conversions, email marketing is actually initiating many of these customer journeys.
