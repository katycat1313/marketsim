## Introduction to Google Ads Structure

Google Ads is built on a hierarchical structure that helps organize your advertising efforts efficiently. Understanding this structure is essential for creating effective campaigns and managing your advertising budget effectively.

The Google Ads account hierarchy consists of four main levels:

1. **Account Level**: The top level that contains all your campaigns, settings, and billing information
2. **Campaign Level**: Where you set your budget, targeting, and other campaign-wide settings
3. **Ad Group Level**: Contains related ads and keywords that target a specific theme
4. **Ad/Keyword Level**: The actual ads that users see and the keywords that trigger them

### Account Level

At the top of the hierarchy is your Google Ads account. This is where:
- You manage billing information
- Access account-wide settings and tools
- View comprehensive performance data across all campaigns
- Set user permissions and access controls

Your Google Ads account is connected to a single email address and contains all your advertising activities on the platform.

### Campaign Level

Campaigns are the organizing containers for your advertising efforts. At this level, you:
- Set daily and monthly budgets
- Choose campaign types (Search, Display, Video, etc.)
- Define campaign goals (sales, leads, website traffic, etc.)
- Select geographic targeting
- Set campaign-wide settings like devices, scheduling, and ad rotation

Each campaign should focus on a specific business goal or product/service category. Separating campaigns allows for better budget control and performance tracking.

### Ad Group Level

Ad groups sit within campaigns and contain a set of related ads and keywords. At this level, you:
- Group together keywords with a common theme
- Create ads that directly relate to those keywords
- Set bid adjustments specific to the ad group
- Refine audience targeting

Well-organized ad groups improve Quality Score and allow for more relevant ads, which leads to better performance and lower costs.

### Ad/Keyword Level

At the most granular level are the individual ads and keywords:
- Ads: The actual text, images, or videos that users see
- Keywords: The search terms that trigger your ads to display

This is where you:
- Write compelling ad copy
- Select relevant keywords
- Choose keyword match types (broad, phrase, exact)
- Set individual keyword bids if needed

## Understanding Campaign Types

Google Ads offers various campaign types, each designed for specific advertising goals:

1. **Search Campaigns**: Text ads that appear on Google search results
2. **Display Campaigns**: Visual ads that appear on websites in the Google Display Network
3. **Video Campaigns**: Video ads that appear on YouTube and across the web
4. **Shopping Campaigns**: Product listings that appear on Google Search and Shopping
5. **App Campaigns**: Ads that promote mobile app installations or engagement

For beginners, Search campaigns are often the best starting point as they target users actively searching for your products or services.

## Key Account Settings

### Budget Management

Google Ads allows you to set both daily and monthly budgets:
- Daily budgets control how much you're willing to spend per day
- Google may occasionally exceed your daily budget but will never charge more than your monthly maximum (daily budget Ã— 30.4)

Effective budget management is crucial for maximizing campaign ROI.

### Location Targeting

You can show your ads to users in specific geographic areas:
- Target by country, region, city, or radius around a location
- Adjust bids for different locations
- Exclude areas where you don't want your ads to show

This feature helps in reaching the most relevant audience for your business.

## Setting Up Your First Campaign

When creating your first Google Ads campaign, follow these steps:

1. Define clear campaign goals
2. Choose the appropriate campaign type
3. Set a reasonable budget
4. Select geographic targeting
5. Create tightly themed ad groups
6. Write compelling ad copy
7. Add relevant keywords
8. Set appropriate bids

## Account Organization Best Practices
