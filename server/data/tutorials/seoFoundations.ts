## Introduction to SEO
Search Engine Optimization (SEO) is the practice of improving a website's visibility in search engine results pages (SERPs). The better your SEO, the more likely your target audience will find your website when searching for relevant topics or products.

## Core On-Page SEO Elements

### Title Tags
The title tag is one of the most important on-page SEO elements. It appears as the clickable headline in search engine results and is often the first impression users have of your page.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep title tags between 50-60 characters
- Include your primary keyword near the beginning
- Make each title unique across your website
- Be descriptive and compelling

**Example:**
\`\`\`html
<title>Organic Arabica Coffee Beans | Fresh Roasted Specialty Coffee</title>
\`\`\`

### Meta Descriptions
While meta descriptions aren't a direct ranking factor, they do influence click-through rates from search results, which can indirectly affect rankings.

**Best Practices:**
- Keep descriptions between 120-155 characters
- Include your primary and secondary keywords naturally
- Include a call to action
- Make each description unique and compelling

**Example:**
\`\`\`html
<meta name="description" content="Shop our premium single-origin, organic Arabica coffee beans, roasted fresh weekly. Free shipping on specialty coffee orders over $30!">
\`\`\`

### Heading Structure
Headings help search engines understand the structure and hierarchy of your content. They also improve readability for users.

**Best Practices:**
- Use only one H1 tag per page
- Include keywords in your headings naturally
- Maintain a logical hierarchy (H1 → H2 → H3)
- Make headings descriptive of the content that follows

**Example:**
\`\`\`html
<h1>Organic Arabica Coffee Beans from Ethiopia</h1>
<h2>Single-Origin Specialty Coffee Characteristics</h2>
<h3>Flavor Profile and Tasting Notes</h3>
<h2>Fresh Roasted Beans: Shipping & Storage</h2>
\`\`\`

### Content Optimization
High-quality, relevant content is crucial for SEO. It should satisfy the user's search intent and provide value.

**Best Practices:**
- Write detailed, unique content (at least 300 words for product pages)
- Include your target keywords naturally (1-2% keyword density)
- Break content into paragraphs with logical structure
- Use bullet points and lists for easy scanning
- Answer questions your audience is asking

### Image Optimization
Images help engage users but need proper optimization to benefit SEO.

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive, keyword-rich file names
- Add alt text to all images that describes the image and includes keywords when relevant
- Compress images for faster loading
- Use appropriate image formats (JPG, PNG, WebP)

**Example:**
\`\`\`html
<img src="ethiopian-arabica-coffee-beans.jpg" alt="Freshly roasted organic Arabica coffee beans from Ethiopia">
\`\`\`

### Internal Linking
Internal links help search engines discover and understand the structure of your website.

**Best Practices:**
- Use descriptive anchor text that includes keywords
- Link to relevant pages within your site
- Create a logical site structure
- Avoid generic link text like "click here" or "learn more"

**Example:**
\`\`\`html
<a href="/coffee/ethiopian-yirgacheffe">Browse our Ethiopian Yirgacheffe coffee selection</a>
\`\`\`
